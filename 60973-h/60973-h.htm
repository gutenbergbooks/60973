<p>The coalman’s season may be the winter, and the
summer the iceman’s harvest, so that it’s possible the
milkman finds his greatest profit in the spring.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is the difference between a grocer who uses
false weights and a highwayman?</p>

Rome-o for what Juli-et?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You know my girl? Her name is Plaster. I go to
court Plaster every night. She is a poor girl, but
there are lots of other girls as por-ous Plaster. I took
her out riding the other day, when the horse ran
away and threw her out and broke her leg in four
places, and her arm in three places. I got some sticking
plaster and put on her leg and arm, and then carried
her home. Next morning she wouldn’t speak to
me.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>She was too stuck up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>

<p>George Washington was the bravest man in the
world. He was never licked in his life.</p>

<p>Then they had to do it behind his back.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been asked when rain falls, does it ever get
up again?</p>

<p>Of course it does, in dew time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I dared to go up on Broadway to-day and a team ran
over me. Just as I was getting up, the driver shouted:
“Look out!”</p>

<p>And what did you say?</p>

<p>I said: “Are you coming back?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I went to church last Sunday and lost my umbrella.
I got up in the congregation and said if I didn’t get
my umbrella I would come here next Sunday and
mention the party’s name that had it. Next morning
when I woke up, my back yard was full of umbrellas.</p>

have to diet.</p>

<p>What color do you prefer?</p>

on eighty million toothpicks.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I die I’m going to take all my gold and silver
with me.</p>

<p>Don’t you do it.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it will melt where you are going.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Oh, I’m the flower of my family, all right.</p>

<p>I wonder if that’s what your brother meant yesterday
when he said you were a blooming idiot?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The young man in love doesn’t care so much about
having a yacht at sea as having a little smack ashore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How do you spell mule?</p>

<p>M-l-e.</p>

A little girl went to the drug store for some pills.</p>

<p>“Anti-bilious?” asked the clerk. “No, sir. It’s
my uncle,” replied the little girl.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That’s my umbrella you have there.</p>

<p>Well, I got it in a pawnshop.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Yes, I have seen the day when Mr. Rich, the millionaire,
did not have a pair of shoes to cover his
feet.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How do you like my suit?</p>

<p>A beautiful suit; who made it?</p>

<p>Carrie Nation.</p>

<p>Why, is she a tailor?</p>

<p>Yes, she made all the saloonkeepers close.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What are you crying about?</p>

<p>A horse ran away with my brother, threw him out
of the carriage, and he has been laid up for six months.</p>

<p>Why, that’s nothing. My brother had a terrible
accident, too; only his was different; he ran away
with the horse. He’s laid up now for six years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

I got on a train to-day and rode as far as Yonkers,
and the conductor came around and looked at my
ticket and said: “Young man, you are on the wrong
train.” I had to get off and walk all the way back to
New York again. I got on another train and went
out about thirty miles, and the conductor came around
and looked at my ticket and said: “Young man, you
are on the wrong train.” I had to get off and walk
back to New York again. I got on another train,
and, of course, was mad and began to swear; a minister,
sitting in a seat behind me, said: “Young man,
stop your swearing. Do you know you are on the road
to hell?” I said: “Here I am on the wrong train
again,” and I had to get off.</p>

<p>I went fishing to-day.</p>

<p>What did you catch?</p>

<p>I caught a good eel.</p>

<p>While I was fishing to-day I was standing in water
six feet deep.</p>

<p>Oh, come off the perch.</p>

I see your sister is getting quite stout now.</p>

<p>Why, she works in the developing room.</p>

<p>“Billy, does your mother give you anything if you
take your medicine without crying?” “No; but she

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“What if I were one of those husbands, my dear,
who get up cross in the morning and bang things

<p>The contents of this book is a complete introduction
to the Stenographic Art, as used for Business
Correspondence and Verbatim Reporting.
Illustrated by Plates having Printed Keys, which
are based wholly upon a system that
has been reduced to every-day practice.
The Signs are all constructed
on simple plans, and can be read
easier than the plainest printed
copy. Each sign indicates a sound.
A boy of 12, by this method, will
learn in a week what would take
an adult a year by the old way. Illustrated
with Numerous Examples.
Any one can, in a short time, Report
Sermons, Speeches, Trials, etc., with ease and
rapidity. Many girls and boys, from this book alone,
have become splendid Reporters, and are now receiving
from $1,500 to $2,000 a year as Expert Stenographers.
You can perfect yourself in a short time,
so that you will have a Life Occupation&mdash;one that always
commands a high salary. It is not a difficult
study. It will be of immense value to any young
man or woman. This is really the only Simple and
Practical Book on Shorthand published, and it will
prove a profitable investment. It will be sent by mail,
postpaid, to any address, on receipt of <span class="sans">30 Cents</span>.</p>

<p>Adapted for both sexes. This is the best letter-writer
published. It teaches how to write a letter on any subject
out of the writer’s own head, or to compose a first-class, intelligent
business letter, or a love letter
or a friendly letter. It gives as samples
hundreds of letters of every kind, and
shows you how to carry on a long correspondence
with a lady or a gentleman&mdash;letters
that will never fail to penetrate
the heart. No other book has this <span class="sans">Mystery
of Secret Correspondence</span>. Only
French books have it. It is the book to
refer to when you want to write what
you cannot find words to express. It
opens all the little rivulets that start
from the soul, enabling you to write on
any topic with ease and elegance; or
how to write a complimentary note, or
how to write for the press. Rules on
spelling correctly, on punctuation, on
directing letters, and an immense
amount of information not to be found in any other book.
There are many young people who are good scholars, but who
are woefully deficient in ordinary letter-writing. They receive
letters from friends, that they postpone answering on account
of their own ignorance of elegant letter-writing, until at last
they remain unanswered, and they lose their correspondent.
Many a son or daughter at school, receives beautiful letters
from home, and wonder why he or she cannot write such letters
in return. It is because they need practical instruction in
letter-writing. It will be sent by mail, postpaid, on receipt
of <span class="sans">30 Cents</span>.</p>

<p>To those that work hard for a mere
existence, we have a few plain words
to say. Every person wants to make
money, and wants to make it fast and
easily. This book will tell them how.
Many worthy people grow gray from
hard work and have nothing to show
for it. It is such people we address.
Among the valuable secrets in this
really great book there are many that
require no capital and but little labor
with no special ability. With any one
of these recipes you can make money
ten times easier than you could by hard
work, and be your own master at that.
This book is crammed full of recipes
that will help you become rich quickly.
Not by peddling and forcing sales, but
by making things that nearly everybody will buy. No
such word as “fail” about it. All the operations can be
done in your own town. No “gift of gab” necessary. The
things will sell themselves. No capital required to begin.
The money rolls in from the start. It will be sent by mail,
postpaid, on receipt of <span class="sans">30 Cents</span>.</p>

<p>A practical treatise on how to perform
modern tricks, by Prof. Hermann. Great
care has been exercised by the author to
include in this book only such tricks as
have never before appeared in print.
This assures the performer a secret and
almost endless fund for suitable material
to be used on all occasions. With
little practice, almost any one can perform
the more simple tricks, and with practice,
as he becomes more adept, he can
perform the most difficult ones. No book
published contains a greater variety of
material for conjurors and sleight-of-hand
performers than this book. Coins,
cards, silk hat, handkerchiefs, balls, are
all introduced in the many programs offered,
thus affording one an endless variety
from which to select for parlor or stage entertainments.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
